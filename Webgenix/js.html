         <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just
             -in-time compiled, object-oriented programming language 
             that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
             JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
              prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class 
              functions.</p>

            <h3>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
             technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables
              interactive web pages and is an essential part of web 
              applications. The vast majority of websites use it, 
              and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine
               to execute it.</h3>
