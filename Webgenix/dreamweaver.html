            <h1>What is Dreamweaver?</h1><br>
            <h3>Adobe Dreamweaver is a proprietary web development tool from Adobe Inc.. It was created by Macromedia in 1997 and developed by them until Macromedia was acquired by
			Adobe Systems in 2005.

Adobe Dreamweaver is available for the macOS and Windows operating systems.

Following Adobe's acquisition of the Macromedia product suite, releases of Dreamweaver subsequent to version 8.0 have been more compliant with W3C standards. Recent versions have
 improved support for Web technologies such as CSS, JavaScript, and various server-side scripting languages and frameworks including ASP (ASP JavaScript, ASP VBScript, ASP.NET C#, 
 ASP.NET VB), ColdFusion, Scriptlet, and PHP.
