            <h3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
                used for describing the presentation of a document 
                written in a markup language like HTML.</h3>
                <ul>
				<li>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
                     Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</li>
                 <li>CSS is designed to enable the separation of
                     presentation and content, including layout,
                     colors, and fonts.</li>
                <li>This separation can improve content
                     accessibility, provide more flexibility and 
                     control in the specification of presentation 
                     characteristics, enable multiple web pages to 
                     share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS
                     in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity
                     and repetition in the structural content.</li>
                         
                <li>Separation of formatting and content also
                     makes it feasible to present the same markup
                     page in different styles for different
                     rendering methods, such as on-screen, in
                     print, by voice (via speech-based browser 
                     or screen reader), and on Braille-based 
                     tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
                     alternate formatting if the content is 
                     accessed on a mobile device.</li></ul>
