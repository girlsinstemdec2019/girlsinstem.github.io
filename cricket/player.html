            <div class="content">  
                Daring, tough and fiercely talented, Virat Kohli is arguably one of the 
                finest batsmen that the country has produced. 
                He has even drawn comparisons with the great Sachin Tendulkar.
                With a firm bottom-hand grip and the ability to smash balls landing on 
                a particular area to any part of the ground at will and without much risk,
                Kohli has carved a niche of his own in Indian cricket. The king of chases 
                as many of his fans have christened him, Kohli is a deeply hammered nail across all formats.

            <div class="rscontent">
                While his exploits in Test cricket leave a lot to be desired, 
                there is no doubting Rohit Sharma’s ability as a batsman. 
                He is the first player in ODI history to have scored three double hundreds,
                 including a world record individual score of 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014, 
                 and that tells you what a talent he is.

            <div class="Msd">
            Under his captaincy, India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, 
            the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed middle-order batsman 
            and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day Internationals (ODIs)
            with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective "finisher" in limited-overs formats.
            He is also regarded by some as one of the best wicket-keepers and captain in modern
            limited-overs international cricket.</div>

            <div class="hp">
                    Hardik Pandya is the perfect modern-day cricketer. 
                    He can strike the ball big, roll his arm over decently and is a 
                    livewire in the field. It is a combination of skills India has long waited
                     for since the retirement of Kapil Dev. India will wish that Pandya keeps working on
                      his game and ends the country’s search for a seam-bowling all-rounder.

            <div class="jb">
                    The Indian T20 League has been the making of many promising young players and Jasprit Bumrah is
                     one of them. Featuring for Mumbai, Bumrah first caught the eye with an unusual bowling action.
                      Blessed with the ability to bowl yorkers and get the steep bounce off the pitch, 
                      the Gujarat pacer has arguably become India’s best bowler in limited-overs cricket since making his
                       international debut.

                <div class="rj">
                        Glimpses of Jadeja's prodigious talent were evident in his debut First-Class game where he 
                        scored 53 for West Zone. He was consequently a member of the 2006 Under-19 World Cup side
                         which reached the final. He made it to the 2008 edition as well where his bowling performance
                          of 2-25 against South Africa in the final played a major role in India's acquisition of the title.
                           A good stint in the Indian T20 league with Rajasthan under the captaincy of Shane Warne who nicknamed
                            him 'Rockstar' and an impressive all-round show in the 2008-09 season prompted selectors to hand him
                             an ODI debut against Sri Lanka. Though India lost, the left-hander impressed with an unbeaten 60.
