            <div>After being granted Test status in 1932, India continued to play the role of whipping boys of cricket for another 20 years. Then in 1952, India humbled the mighty English in Madras and have never looked back since. The country's cricketing annals teem with some remarkable cricketing achievements.

<div>                The Test victory in 1952 and the maiden series triumph against Pakistan in the same year were expected to give a shot in the arm to Indian cricket. But nothing such happened and the Indian team went on a downward slide.

                But the 1970s witnessed the emergence of a strong Indian side that boasted of players such as Sunil Gavaskar and the dreaded spin quartet. This group of players was responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar.

            <div>                During the 1980s, players such as Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri and Krish Srikanth came into reckoning and India thrashed the formidable West Indians to win the World Cup in 1983.
