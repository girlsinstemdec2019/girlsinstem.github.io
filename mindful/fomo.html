        <div class="fomo"><b>FOMO-Fear Of Missing Out</b></div>
    <div class="information">The fear of missing out has been described by researchers as "the uneasy and sometimes all-consuming feeling that you’re missing out—that your peers are doing, in the know about, or in possession of more or something better than you."

            And while it has presumably been around for centuries (you can see evidence of FOMO in ancient texts), it has only been scientifically studied during the past few decades, beginning with a 1996 research study by marketing strategist, Dr. Dan Herman. Since the advent of social media, however, FOMO has become more obvious and has been studied more often. 
            
            Social media has accelerated the FOMO phenomenon in several ways. It provides a situation in which you are comparing your regular life to the highlights of others' lives. Therefore, your sense of "normal" becomes skewed and you seem to be doing worse than your peers. You might see detailed photos showing that your friends enjoyed fun times without you, which is something that people may not have been so readily aware of in past generations.
            
            Social media creates a platform for bragging; it is where things, events, and even happiness itself seems to be in competition at times. People are comparing their best, picture-perfect experiences, which may lead you to wonder what you are lacking.

            <div class="info"><b>Research</b></div><div class="research">As more research on FOMO is conducted and becomes available, we are getting a clearer picture of what it entails and how it affects us. The picture is not pretty, as there are many negative effects of FOMO, and it is more common than you might expect. Consider the following:

                    Social networking sites are both a cause and an effect of FOMO. Unsurprisingly, adolescents use social networking sites at a high rate and may experience FOMO as a result. Interestingly, however, FOMO acts as a mechanism that triggers higher social networking usage. Girls experiencing depression tend to use social networking sites at a greater rate. Boys, on the other hand, found that anxiety was a trigger for greater social media use. This shows that increased use of social media can lead to higher stress rates caused by FOMO.
                    FOMO associated with social media usage transcends age and gender. FOMO can be experienced by people of all ages, several studies have found. One study in the Psychiatry Research journal found that the fear of missing out was linked to a greater smartphone and social media usage and that this link was not associated with age or gender. The research also found that both social media use and "problematic" smartphone usage was linked with a greater experience of FOMO. Smartphone usage was related to fears of negative and even positive evaluations by others as well as linked to negative effects on mood.
