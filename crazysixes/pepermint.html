                        <li>INGREDIENTS<br>
                                1 box of brownie mix, prepared ( I used Duncan Hines Chewy, Fudgy Brownie Mix)<br>
                                6 oz white chocolate (I used Bakers Premium White Chocolate baking squares)<br>
                                12 candy canes (I had a lot left over)<br>
                                
                                <br>INSTRUCTIONS<br>
                                Bake brownies according to package for fudge-like brownies and let cool.<br>
                                Use a mini ice cream scoop to scoop out the brownies from the pan.<br> I leave the edges since they are hard and chewy. Eat them instead ðŸ™‚
                                Shape into balls and place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
                                Place the balls in the freezer to firm up. (about 15-30 minutes)
                                Crush up the candy canes in a food processor, set aside.
                                Place the white chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave in intervals of 30 seconds, stirring, until completely melted.
                                Remove brownie balls from freezer.
                                Dip the brownies into the chocolate until completely coated. You may need to swirl it around. I stuck a toothpick into the balls to make this easier.
                                Place the truffles onto the wax paper, remove toothpick, and immediately sprinkle the tops with crushed peppermint.
                                Repeat with remaining brownie balls.
                                Let chocolate harden and enjoy!
                                Store in the fridge for best texture.
