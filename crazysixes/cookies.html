 Red Velvet Cookies
 <div class="images/"></div>
 
 <img src="images/red-velvet-cookies-3.jpg" width="450" height="400">
 
 <p>Ingredients<br>
1/2 cup butter, softened<br>
1/2 cup brown sugar<br>
1/2 cup sugar<br>
1 egg<br>
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
1/2 tsp salt<br>
1/4 tsp espresso powder, optional<br>
1 Tbsp buttermilk*<br>
1 1/3 cup all-purpose flour<br>
1/2 tsp baking soda<br>
1 tsp cornstarch<br>
2 1/2 Tbsp cocoa powder<br>
1 Tbsp red food coloring<br>
1 cup white chocolate chips<br></p>

<p>Instructions<br>
1.Beat butter until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add in brown sugar and white sugar and beat until well creamed. Beat in the egg, vanilla extract, salt, buttermilk, and espresso powder. Add in the food coloring and mix. Once combined, set aside.<br>
2.In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and cocoa powder. Once combined, slowly incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Once combined, if the dough is not as red as you would like, feel free to add in more food coloring until it's at your desired color.<br>
3.Add in white chocolate chips. Mix. Once combined, chill the dough in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. (Or, if you're impatient like me, scoop the dough onto a baking sheet, and pop into the freezer for five minutes and then bake).
4.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.<br>
5.Scoop dough into 2-inch Tbsp balls, place 2-inches apart on a cookie sheet.<br>
6.Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until slightly soft to the touch but not gooey.<br>
7.Allow to cool and enjoy!
