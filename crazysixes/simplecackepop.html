                        <li>INGREDIENTS
                                Chocolate Cake, prepared (I used Â½ of a 9x13 devils food box cake)<br>
                                Chocolate Frosting (amount depends on moistness of cake. I used two big spoonfuls. See video)
                                2 boxes Premium white chocolate ( I used Baker's brand) *update* I now use candy melts
                                cake pop sticks
                                sprinkles<br>
                                
                               <br> INSTRUCTIONS<br>
                                Add cake to a large bowl.<br>
                                Crumble until it resembles fine crumbs<br>
                                Add in frosting a little bit at a time until cake is moist and can hold a ball shape, yet still slightly crumbly.<br>
                                Use your hands to incorporate the frosting into the cake crumbs.<br>
                                Use a mini ice cream scoop and scoop out two balls of cake mixture.<br>
                                Roll the mixture into a tight ball and place on a plate.<br>
                                Repeat until all the cake mixture has been rolled into balls.<br>
                                Melt 2-4 ounces of white chocolate in the microwave.<br>
                                Dip the tip of the cake pop sticks into the white chocolate and insert into the cake balls about half-way.<br>
                                Freeze for about 20 minutes.<br>
                                Meanwhile prepare all of your decorating supplies.<br>
                                Melt the remaining chocolate in a large cup. Make sure you have enough chocolate to completely submerge the cake ball.<br>
                                Remove cake balls from freezer.<br>
                                Dip cake balls carefully into the chocolate until covered.<br>
                                Let the excess chocolate drip off. Swirl and tap gently if needed.<br>
                                Add the sprinkles while the chocolate is still wet. It will harden quickly.<br>
                                Stick the decorated cake pop into a styrofoam block to finish setting.<br>
                                Place into the freezer to speed up setting time.<br>
                                Cover with a clear treat bag & ribbon for gift giving, if desired.<br>
                                Store in a cool area in a single layer, in an airtight container.<br>
                                Enjoy!</li>
