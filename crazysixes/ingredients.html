                    <li> INGREDIENTS
                            3 large Granny Smith apples<br>
                            18 sucker sticks<br>
                            1 1/2 cups caramel baking bits or caramel chews of choice<br>
                            1 tablespoon heavy cream<br>
                            Optional Toppings: crushed nuts crushed cookies, sprinkles<br>
                            
                            <br>INSTRUCTIONS<br>
                            Peel apples.<br>
                            Using a melon baller, scoop out apple balls.<br>
                            Insert the sucker stick into the apple. Be careful not to puncture the stick through the other end.<br>
                            In a small pot add caramel baking bits and heavy cream.<br>
                            Melt over low heat, stirring constantly until completely melted.<br>
                            Fill a small bowl with icy water. Set aside.<br>
                            Thoroughly dry the apple with a paper towel to remove excess moisture from the surface.<br>
                            Dip the apple into the mixture, swirling to coat and being sure to get the caramel on the stick a little. This will help keep out the water on the next step.<br>
                            Immediately dip the caramel apple into the icy water for a few second to quick set the caramel.<br>
                            Dry the caramel off gently with a paper towels.<br>
                            Press the top of the caramel apple into desired topping if using.<br>
                            Place caramel apple into the fridge or freezer to finish setting.<br>
                            Remove from fridge of freezer.<br>
                            Enjoy!<br>
                            Repeat with all the mini caramel apples.<br>
