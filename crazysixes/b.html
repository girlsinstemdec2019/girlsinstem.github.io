<LI>Preheat the oven at gas 4/160C fan/ 180C and 
grease the six baking tins with butter.</LI>
<LI>In a bowl, sieve the flour, powdered sugar, baking powder and salt. Keep this mixture aside.</LI>
<LI>Whisk the eggs with a beater. As soon as the consistency of the eggs become double, add milk and vanilla essence and whisk it again.</LI>
<LI>Then gradually add the mixture from the bowl and continue whisking. Whisk in one direction in order to avoid air bubbles.</LI>
<LI>Once the batter becomes smooth, divide it into six equal parts. Add the food color to each part and mix until the desired color is obtained.</LI>
<LI>Bake each tin for 12 minutes. Insert a toothpick in the middle of the tin to check whether the cake is baked thoroughly. Once the cakes are baked, 
allow them to cool on wire racks.</LI>
<LI>Whisk the cream cheese along with vanilla extract. When a smooth consistency is obtained, gradually add the icing sugar and using the cut-fold method, sift the icing sugar.</LI>
<LI>On a cake stand, smear a little icing in the middle and place the first layer of the cake. Now, spread a light coat of icing on the cake layer and place 
another layer of the cake. Repeat this for all the layers.</LI>
