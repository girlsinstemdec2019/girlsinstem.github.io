        <h1>Italian cuisine </h1>
        <h2>Italy</h2>
       <p> Italy (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja] (About this soundlisten)), officially the 
        Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica Italiana [reˈpubblika itaˈljaːna]),
        is a European country consisting of a peninsula delimited
        by the Alcps and surrounded by several islands. Italy is located in south-
        central Europe,and it is also considered a part of western Europe.
        The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi) and
        shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and the 
        enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. Italy has a 
        territorial exclave in Switzerland (Campione) and a maritime exclave in the
        unisian Sea (Lampedusa). With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the 
        fourth-most populous member state of the European Union.</p>


        <h2>Italian Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Italian cuisine has a tradition of dishes based on wheat products (such as 
        bread and pasta), vegetables, cheese, fish, and meat, usually prepared in 
        such a manner as to preserve their ingredients' natural qualities, appearance 
        and taste.This kind of cuisine puts a stress on lightness and healthy nutrition
        with natural unprocessed foods, and tends to vary greatly not only with the 
        seasons but also between the various regions of the country: mountainous regions
        have dishes rich in proteins, and prefer meat, butter, and cheese, while 
        seaside regions have dishes rich in vegetables and fish.
        In this way, the cuisine is born of the people, the territory and the seasons
        and is not pulled out of nowhere for no rhyme or reason.</p>

        <h3>2.Panzanella</h3>
        <p>Panzanella [pantsaˈnɛlla] or panmolle [pamˈmɔlle] is a Tuscan chopped 
        salad of soaked stale bread, onions and tomatoes that is popular in the 
        summer. It often includes cucumbers, sometimes basil and is dressed with 
        olive oil and vinegar.Panzanella was based on onions, not tomatoes, until the
        20th century. 
        Modern panzanella is generally made of stale bread soaked in water and 
        squeezed dry, red onions, tomatoes, olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper.

        <h3>3.Bruschetta.</h3>
        <p>Bruschettais an antipasto (starter dish) from Italy consisting of grilled 
        bread rubbed with garlic and topped with olive oil and salt. Variations may 
        include toppings of tomato, vegetables, beans, cured meat, or cheese. A popular
        dish is bruschetta with tomatoes; one recipe popular outside Italy involves 
        basil, fresh tomato, garlic and onion or mozzarella. Bruschetta is usually 
        served as a snack or appetizer. In some countries, the prepared topping is 
        marketed as bruschetta.
        In Italy, bruschetta is often prepared using a brustolina grill. In the 
        Abruzzo region of Italy a variation of bruschetta made with a salame called 
        ventricina is served. Raw pork products and spices encased in pig bladder are 
        aged and the paste spread on open slices of bread which are sometimes grilled.
        The dish was developed as a way of salvaging bread that was going stale. In 
        Tuscany it is called fettunta and it is usually served without toppings, 
        especially in November, to taste the first oil of the season.</p>
