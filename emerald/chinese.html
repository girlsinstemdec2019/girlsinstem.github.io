        <h1>CHINA</h1>
        <p>Stretching 3,100 miles (5,000 kilometers) from east to west and 3,400 
            miles (5,500 kilometers) from north to south, China is a large country 
            with widely varying landscapes.With a population of 1.3 billion, China 
            has more people than any other country on Earth. About a third of the
            population lives in cities. The rest of the people live in the country.
            Arts and crafts have a long history in China. Thousands of years ago the Chinese were some of the first people to use silk, jade, bronze, wood, and paper to make art. The artistic writing called calligraphy was invented in China.Much of China's modern beliefs and philosophies are based on the teachings of a government official who lived nearly 3,000 years ago. Kongfuzi, also known as Confucius, taught people the value of such things as morality, kindness, and education.</p>

            
            <h2>CHINESE CUISINE </h2>
            <p>Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.</p>

            <h2>1.HOTPOT</h2>
            <p>Hotpot is a dish to tell apart real Chinese food lovers. If you really appreciate hotpot rather than just ordering fired rice, chow mein, and dim sum all the time, you are truly a Chinese cuisine fan!The secret of whether a hotpot is good or not lies in the broth, in which all the meat slices and vegetables are cooked. Normally you get to choose your own broth flavor, such as mushroom, tomato, original, or spicy. But still, the flavor can be different according to the sauce you choose to go with the meat. There are hundreds of kinds: a classic one is peanut butter with smashed garlic and chopped onion dressed with sesame oil.</p>
