            Kimchi refers to often fermented vegetable dishes usually made with napa cabbage, Korean radish, or sometimes cucumber.
             There are 4 types of raw materials which are major ones: spices, seasonings, and other additional materials.
              Red and black pepper, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, onion, and mustard are the example of spices.
              There are endless varieties with regional variations, and it is served as a side dish or cooked into soups and rice dishes. 
              In the late 15th century, it depicted Korean's custom that Korean ancestors buried kimchi jars in the ground for storage for the entire winter season, as fermented foods can keep for several years.
              These were stored in traditional Korean mud pots known as jangdokdae, although with the advent of refrigerators, special kimchi freezers and commercially produced kimchi, this practice has become less common. 
              Kimchi is a vegetable-based food which includes low calorie, low fat, and no cholesterol. Also, it is a rich source of various vitamins and minerals.
             It contains vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, and vitamin K and minerals which are calcium, iron, phosphorus, and selenium.
            South Koreans eat an average of 40 pounds of kimchi each year.
