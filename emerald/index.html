            <p> One of the biggest achievments of the modern world is global connectivity. While we mostly talk about technology and related progresses when we think about connectivity, one of the best topics to talk about is the connectivity we have in food cuisines around the world.<br> Today, someone who hasn't even traveled to India could say that they have had food native to the Indian cuisine. </p>
