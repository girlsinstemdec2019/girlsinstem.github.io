    <span class="text">        
    Mexican cuisine began about 9000 years ago, when agricultural communities such as the Maya formed, domesticating maize,
    creating the standard process of corn nixtamalization, and establishing their foodways. Successive waves of other Mesoamerican groups brought with them their own cooking methods. 
    These included the Olmec, Teotihuacanos, Toltec, Huastec, Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomi, Purepecha, Totonac, Mazatec, and Mazahua.
